# About the "Dash-Map-Board" project
_aka Easy way to create map-based time-aware dashboard for "lightweight" coders_

## Short description
Our project goal is to create a configurable time-aware dashboard using ArcGIS JS API and amCharts JS Charts.
If you're new with this whole programming stuff, you only have to change some parameters in config.json with which the "Configuration guide" will help.
If you like to dive into codes you can also alter HTML, CSS and JS files as well to create a custom dashboard with map.

## Preparations and preconfigurations
You will need at least one ESRI service which can be time-aware
